        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is America Rivera, I am currently an undergraduate student attending the University of California, Riverside. I am majoring in Sociology and am planning in declaring a focus of Law and Society soon. I was born in Santa Ana, California, originally I was an Orange County baby but my family moved to San Bernardino, CA when I was two. I have lived in San Bernardino for my entire life. I attended Arroyo Valley High School located in San Bernardino. I was secretary of the Business Academy at my school as well as a member of the Global leadership (AP AND IB) academy along with Business. I was Historian for my schoolâ€™s key club and was a member of about 4+ other clubs. Key club is one of the clubs I was a member of is an international, student-led organization that provides its members with opportunities to provide service, build character and develop leadership. The Business & Logistics Academy is committed to providing students with hands-on experience in the classroom. Students are provided with the skills to Build Your Own Virtual Business & Become Certified In Microsoft Office Manage Your Money & Your Future, Work In Global Logistics (AMAZON, Stater Bros., Under Armour, Pep Boys, BNSF & many more). One of my proudest titles is a member of the Young Legislator 47th district program. The Young Legislators program provides a unique opportunity to learn how public policy is developed. During the next few months, you will come to understand the role state legislators, local government officials and others play in developing public policy. You will have the opportunity to meet local elected officials, prominent community members, and familiarize yourself with the 47th Assembly District. Due to this program, I was able to go to Sacramento and have presented a policy dear to my heart to California Assembly members. Additionally having awards from the city of San Bernardino, my school district, the California Senate and Assembly. I am an avid humanitarian and animal lover. Besides that of education, I love to Volunteer, going to my local dog shelter and volunteering as well as park cleanups. I want to become a lawyer or work with public policy to try and change the world for the better. My top choices would be an immigration lawyer to help immigrant families stay together because coming from an immigrant family I understand firsthand how scary damaging the process could be. It is something many go through with no guidance and get taken advantage of by lawyers and government officials all the time. If I work with the public policy I would pass policy to protect minorities. POC and LGBTQ+ laws would be my priorities. This is because as a member of these two communities I would want to know the future of these communities are safe from what society has thrown to them for a long time. Hopefully, I will graduate from the University of California, Riverside in June 2024 with my BA in Sociology. <br><br>
